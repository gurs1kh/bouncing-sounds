# bouncing-sounds

A basic simulation of balls bouncing around in a circle that make sounds everytime they bounce off the wall.
You can also click and drag on the canvas to insert a new ball with a given velocity.

For custom scales, use values from -6 to 17 were 0 is C#.

The piano samples were taken from http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html
